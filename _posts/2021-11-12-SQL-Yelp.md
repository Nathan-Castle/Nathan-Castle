The goal of this analysis is to apply my SQL knowledge to a potential real-life use case. Within this use case, I will be playing the role of a real-world data scientist to both answer specific questions for an organization and make inferences based on my discoveries.

Yelp is a platform for users to provide reviews and rate their interactions with a variety of organizations (businesses, restaurants, health clubs, hospitals, local governmental offices, charitable organizations, etc.). Yelp has made a portion of their real dataset available for personal/educational use and is what this analysis is based on.

With the help of the ER diagram below I will split my analysis into two parts:

## Part 1: Profiling and Understanding 
This section will be to understand the different tables and finding unique insights with the data.

Understanding the total and unique records.

{% highlight SQL %}
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records
FROM attribute

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(*)) AS total_unique_records
FROM business
{% endhighlight %}

Understanding if there are any NULL values in the columns for the user table.

{% highlight SQL %}
SELECT id, name, review_count, yelping_since, useful, funny, cool, fans, average_stars, compliment_hot, compliment_more, compliment_profile, compliment_cute, compliment_list, compliment_note, compliment_plain, compliment_cool, compliment_funny, compliment_writer, compliment_photos
FROM user
WHERE id = NULL or name = NULL or review_count = NULL or yelping_since = NULL or useful = NULL or funny = NULL or cool = NULL or fans= NULL or average_stars= NULL or compliment_hot= NULL or compliment_more= NULL or compliment_profile= NULL or compliment_cute= NULL or compliment_list= NULL or compliment_note= NULL or compliment_plain = NULL or compliment_cool= NULL or compliment_funny= NULL or compliment_writer= NULL or compliment_photos= NULL;
{% endhighlight %}

Understanding the average stars for all restaurants in the reviews table.

{% highlight SQL %}
SELECT MIN(stars) AS min_stars,
    MAX(stars) AS max_stars,
    AVG(stars) AS mean_stars
FROM review
{% endhighlight %}

Finding the cities with the most reviews.

{% highlight SQL %}
SELECT b.city,
    SUM(b.review_count)
FROM business b 
GROUP BY b.city
ORDER BY SUM(b.review_count) DESC
{% endhighlight %}

Finding the distribution of star ratings in the city of Avon.

{% highlight SQL %}
SELECT stars,
    COUNT(stars) as count_stars
FROM business
WHERE city = 'Avon'
GROUP BY stars
{% endhighlight %}

Finding if posting more reviews correlates with more fans.

{% highlight SQL %}
SELECT name,
    review_count,
    fans
FROM user
ORDER BY review_count DESC
{% endhighlight %}

Subquery to find user sentiment of hate and love reviews.

{% highlight SQL %}
SELECT (SELECT COUNT(text)
        FROM review
        WHERE text like '%love%') AS love,
        (SELECT COUNT(text)
        FROM review
        WHERE text like '%hate%') AS hate
{% endhighlight %}


Understanding the difference in businesses within Las Vegas for star ratings and review_count.

{% highlight SQL %}
SELECT b.name,
    b.city,
    c.category,
    b.stars,
    b.review_count,
    h.hours,
    c.business_id
FROM business b
INNER JOIN category c ON b.id = c.business_id
INNER JOIN hours h ON c.business_id = h.business_id
WHERE city like 'Las Vegas'
GROUP BY b.stars 
{% endhighlight %}

## Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

This section is about applying a real-world use case. For my analysis, I am going to be transforming and querying the data in a way to predict the overall star value of an organization based on characteristics provided in the different tables. The key here is to perform the upfront transformations and analysis to present the data in a way that a modelling team could inherent and perform the modelling components.

To achieve this goal there are several factors to consider:
-	There are multiple attributes or categories responding to each organization spread across multiple tables/columns.
-	Days of the week are aggregated into one column including hours open.
-	Zip/postal code includes all US states and one Canadian city.
-	There may be duplicated id’s.

Addressing these factors:
-	We can group_concat for distinct category names across the column to combine all categories into a readable format. Same can be done with attributes.
-	Days of the week will need the use of CASE statements. CASE statements are similar to IF statements where they will take a condition and return what you are looking for. This will be needed for every day.
-	Postal code for the Canadian city can be changed to match the same format (without spaces) to stay consistent with US zip codes.
-	We can group by id’s at the end to ensure there are no multiple id’s.

This is the final code:

{% highlight SQL %}
SELECT b.id,
    b.name,
    b.address,
    b.city,
    b.state,
    replace(b.postal_code, ' ','') AS postal_code,
    b.latitude,
    b.longitude,
    b.review_count,
    MAX(CASE
    WHEN h.hours LIKE "%monday%" THEN TRIM(h.hours,'%MondayTuesWednesThursFriSatSun|%') 
    END) AS monday_hours,
    MAX(CASE
    WHEN h.hours LIKE "%tuesday%" THEN TRIM(h.hours,'%MondayTuesWednesThursFriSatSun|%') 
    END) AS tuesday_hours,
    MAX(CASE
    WHEN h.hours LIKE "%wednesday%" THEN TRIM(h.hours,'%MondayTuesWednesThursFriSatSun|%') 
    END) AS wednesday_hours,
    MAX(CASE
    WHEN h.hours LIKE "%thursday%" THEN TRIM(h.hours,'%MondayTuesWednesThursFriSatSun|%') 
    END) AS thursday_hours,
    MAX(CASE
    WHEN h.hours LIKE "%friday%" THEN TRIM(h.hours,'%MondayTuesWednesThursFriSatSun|%') 
    END) AS friday_hours,
    MAX(CASE
    WHEN h.hours LIKE "%saturday%" THEN TRIM(h.hours,'%MondayTuesWednesThursFriSatSun|%') 
    END) AS saturday_hours,
    MAX(CASE
    WHEN h.hours LIKE "%sunday%" THEN TRIM(h.hours,'%MondayTuesWednesThursFriSatSun|%') 
    END) AS sunday_hours,
    LOWER(GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT(c.category))) AS categories,
    LOWER(GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT(a.name))) AS attributes,
    b.stars
FROM business b
INNER JOIN hours h ON b.id = h.business_id
INNER JOIN category c ON b.id = c.business_id
INNER JOIN attribute a ON b.id = a.business_id
GROUP BY b.id
ORDER BY b.name
{% endhighlight %}
