Throughout my university experience, I have always wanted to create a website to showcase my experiences. However, I thought it took an extremely strong technical ability and got discouraged. Well, here we are now. Through this website, I plan to showcase my journey into the data world by taking it one step at a time. Currently, there should only be a home page with an about section. As time goes on I hope to showcase projects, work experience, certifications, and interesting topics.

Stay tuned for more!
