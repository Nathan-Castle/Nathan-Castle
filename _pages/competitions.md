# Business Analytics and Decision Making (BADM) Hackathon
- 1st Place Technical
- 1st Place Storytelling

## [What](https://beediehackathon.bus.sfu.ca):
The BADM Hackathon is a yearly event hosted by Jason Ho and the Beedie School of Business. Students have 24 hours to analyze a real-world business case, build a predictive model from a given dataset and communicate the results/recommendations to industry professionals. These industry professionals are analytics leaders from reputable organizations such as Aritzia, Best Buy, Coast Capital Savings, Vancouver Coastal Health and many more! The bracket consists of five groups that contain five teams within each group. Each team will present three times to different industry professional judges and the winner of each group advances to the finals. The winners will split prizes of $3,000.

## Objectives:
This year’s BADM Hackathon case was all about digital health. A primary understanding was to know the difference between MSP (Medical Services Plan) and non-MSP services in British Columbia. In short, the provincial government covers the costs of any hospital or doctor services through MSP. Non-MSP services are health services that are paid out of pocket or by third party insurance such as mental health, therapy, and dentists. A primary goal between this distinction of services was to target and grow the division of digital health solutions in the non-MSP industry. Specifically, we had to use our machine learning models from the datasets provided to predict the “power user” and build user profiles based on their characteristics. This “power user” is defined as a user of non-MSP services that would be more likely to use digital health solutions from the organization. 

## Thoughts: 
This was an amazing experience that I was proud to be a part of and learned how to present technical solutions with storytelling. Going into this hackathon, I was excited to combine my previous case competition presentation skills with my newfound technical skills to get the best of both worlds. My team and I worked extremely hard to combine our business domain knowledge with the technical world to get the best models possible. Furthermore, I was impressed with my ability to remain calm under pressure, while presenting in front of these established industry professionals. It was astonishing to see how supportive they were after the presentations and the feedback was extremely helpful. I would recommend this hackathon to anyone looking to deepen either their technical or storytelling skills.

# Vancouver Datajam Hackathon
- Top 5 Solution

## [What](https://www.vancouverdatajam.ca):
Vancouver Datajam is a virtual one-week hackathon where participants develop their coding skills under industry professionals. Additionally, a weekend of workshops is hosted by advanced analytic professionals including topics such as Git and Github control, machine learning with R, Data structures in python, python dash, and intro to notable and the python data stack. Each team is focused on a topic chosen by the lead “hacker” and must develop a small presentation show case the work at the end of the week.

## Objectives:
This year’s Datajam theme was health in our communities and our specific project was a partnership with the Vancouver Island Health Authority. The objective of the partnership was for the team to develop an R package that parses through SPEAK survey data and generates visualizations. The BC COVID-19 SPEAK survey is a web-based population health survey to elicit BC resident experience, knowledge and actions during the COVID-19 pandemic, understand the impacts of COVID19, and to plan approaches for future public health measures. We were given the 2020 and 2021 SPEAK survey datasets to allow for comparisons between years.

## Thoughts: 
This was my first extremely technical hackathon where most of the components were based on coding and not presenting. Furthermore, I was tasked with the modelling/analysis and the documentation. From this experience, I learned how to be proficient with the creation of functions for the reproducibility of code. I was originally nervous because my fellow teammates (11) were either data engineers, scientists, or analysts. However, I exceeded my own expectations because I was able to keep up and code just as well as everyone else. This created a sense of euphoria and belonging because I knew this is the type of work I want to do in the future. 

# Elite Case Competition

## [What](https://beedie.sfu.ca/student-life/undergraduates/competitions/beedie-competitions):
The ELITE Case Competition is intended to be a high-level competition for students with prior case competition experience. Successful teams will have in-depth financial analysis, including modelling or projections where relevant, and are expected to conduct significant secondary research to inform decision making and support all assumptions. Students are given nine days to deliberate and produce a comprehensive presentation to showcase to industry professional judges from Telus, Deloitte, KPMG, Apply Digital and CGI.

## Objectives:
This year’s case was about helping the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) indigenous peoples of Adelaide Australia. The main objective was to develop a recommendation and solution for the APY Art Centre Collective directors to expand locations from Sydney to Adelaide. Some factors that needed to be considered were financial, socio-economic, political, risk mitigation, market penetration strategy and technological. Substantial secondary research needed to be accomplished for understanding the indigenous culture of APY, the global art industry and Australian laws/regulations.

## Thoughts:
Upon release of the case, I was extremely worried because I had little to no knowledge about art, Australia, and indigenous people in Australia. It was almost as if this case was designed for me to have no domain knowledge coming into it. However, through perseverance and determination to develop an excellent understanding of all aspects in the case, my team and I became mini experts. This was my first senior experience with case competitions where I learned how to tackle an unfamiliar and challenging business case. Additionally, I really learned the power of time management and effective collaboration with teammates by setting clear deadlines and goals. 

# BUS 201 Case Competition

## [What](https://beedie.sfu.ca/student-life/competitions/bus-201-case-challenge):
The BUS 201 Case Challenge is a required experiential learning component of BUS 201 and takes place every November. It is the introduction to the world of case competitions for Beedie School of Business undergraduate students. Approximately 500 students and 100 teams present their business case solutions to panels of judges consisting of academics, industry professionals, and senior students.

## Objectives:
This year’s case was tailored towards raising awareness, proposing a recommendation, and finding a solution to “fast fashion” for H&M. Secondary research was needed to understand the environmental impact on the exponentially growing fashion industry. In addition, the SWOT, PESTEL and stakeholder analysis frameworks were used to understand H&M’s current situation.

## Thoughts: 
In high-school, I was always nervous with presentations, so coming into my first ever case competition I was especially anxious. Moreover, this was my first experience working in a team to solve a real-world business problem and being able to coherently present a solution. It proved to be a challenging experience as I was thrown into the “deep end.” However, everyone has to start somewhere, and I was able to gain invaluable experience about storytelling, analysis and how to approach a case.
