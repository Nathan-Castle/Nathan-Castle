I am a 5th year student majoring in business with concentrations in finance and management information systems. Additionally, I am pursuing a minor in statistics with an emphasis on statistical analysis in data science.

Throughout my university experience, I have always found a passion for courses that delved deeper into the quantitative world. This led me to the investment banking side of finance where I thrived on those quantitative aspects. However, I quickly found myself not enjoying the culture and transitioned into accounting. With a year of corporate work experience in accounting, I realized that I wanted to be challenged in technical ways that accounting would never provide. 

This takes me to the beginning of my data journey where I immediately found a passion for data storytelling. I immersed myself into the technical components by learning R, Python, SQL and Tableau. Additionally, I have found myself taking advantage of the “Zoom era” by networking with data science professionals across North America to further develop my knowledge of the industry and understand the passion from others.

Currently, I am in a more data-driven role as a Finance Analyst at a FinTech company. Within my role, I am constantly performing financial data analysis on internal projects to help drive decisions within the company.

## About Me
Outside of work and school, I am always trying to improve my technical acumen by working on personal projects with the use of either R, Python, SQL or Tableau. Additionally, I try to improve my critical thinking and presentation skills by participating in hackathons or case competitions. 

When my life is not revolved around work/school/projects, I spend most of my time taking care of my puppy. His favourite thing to do is run circles around everyone until he is tired. Moreover, I enjoy being outside playing soccer and exploring Vancouver. However, when I am trying to relax, I like playing chess and games with friends.
